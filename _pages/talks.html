    <p>Over the years I have spoken at many conferences on a variety
    of topics related to (Free Software) engineering. Proudly, I try
    to make my talks humorous and approachable without losing focus on
    the important message at the heart of the presentation.</p>
    
    <p>A selection of my past presentations are displayed below. If
    you think I might be a valuable addition to your future event,
    please feel free to <a href="mailto:paul@baggerspion.net">contact
    me</a>.</p>

      <summary><b>Berlin Chef Meetup, June 2017</b></summary>
      {% include youtube.html id="dg6BvgQxEPw" %}
      <p>This session will take you through the journey of learning
      how we write, build and run packages for Habitat, before
      exploring the packaging of CrateDB. CrateDB, of course, is not
      just another database and special consideration must be given to
      packaging CrateDB in a CrateDB-friendly manner. In this session
      we will explore the the endocode/cratedb package that is
      available for download through Habitat and future improvements
      to this package.</p>

      <summary><b>SQL NYC, December 2016</b></summary>
      <p>Hungry?</p>

      <p>In this talk, Paul Adams shows how to gain insights into
      public data from New York City by using Crate, a distributed SQL
      database. Join this talk to understand how Crate, Apache Mesos
      and Packet infrastructure can work together to deliver simple,
      SQL-based querying of Big Data.</p>

      <p>Using the open data set of 311 incidents in New York, Paul
      will show how we can quickly explore life in the Big Apple
      through a series of increasingly probing queries. Learn how to
      meet customer's demands for your data with Crate's simple
      scaling and how to explore that data using standard SQL.</p>

      <p>Still hungry? Who needs Yelp making recommendations, when
      sometimes it is quicker to know where to avoid? This talk has
      the answers.</p>

      <summary><b>Berlin Docker Meetup, October 2016</b></summary>
      <p>Orchestrating Your Data Layer With Docker Engine 1.12 and
      Crate. Based on the recent Docker Engine with its Swarm Mode,
      Paul will demonstrate how easy it is to setup and manage a Crate
      database cluster.</p>

      {% include youtube.html id="MD-RwSw-NGA" %}
      <p>So you had an idea for an awesome software product and
      started to build up your team of engineers around it. Two things
      are almost inevitable: you chose some super cool programming
      language like Clojure and you're doing Scrum for the
      process. Good for you.</p>

      <p>When your company grows, you end up with multiple Scrum
      teams. But you also end up with new activities: documentation,
      blogging, demos, submissions to conferences to show-off your
      awesome heap of Clojure. How are you going to get all of *that*
      done?</p>

      <p>"The book" tells you to mix all these activities in with your
      Scrum engineering teams. "The Book" was also probably written by
      someone who has never had to do devrel in their lives (or, who
      hates devrel engineers). Numerous problems exist at the
      interface between product engineering and devrel and the result
      is your devrel backlog can get backed-up.</p>

      <p>Dr. Paul (not a real doctor) has the laxative you need! In
	this talk he presents his experience of structuring multiple
	Scrum teams at Crate.IO in order to loosen-up the devrel
	backlog: ensuring highly quality feature documentation,
	getting out those blog posts and showing-off our lovely heap
	of Clojure*.</p>

      <p>*Crate is written in Java.</p>

      <summary><b>Write The Docs, August 2015</b></summary>
      {% include youtube.html id="35AzPlwAhNg" %}
      <p>Community Management in Free Software communities is still an
      emerging field and has produced a spectrum of practitioners:
      from master-manipulators of social media, to those more focused
      on metrics and data as a means to driving process. Either way,
      the state of the art is still largely driven by the needs of
      technical contributors to projects.</p>

      <p>Good documentation is a crucial component in a software
      product and yet often technical writers are overlooked as
      important stakeholders of the process. Within the community,
      there are undoubtedly common problems between engineers and
      technical writers. Software Engineering is full of laws; can we
      show that these laws apply to technical writers as a means to
      help bridge the chasm between developers and technical
      writers??</p>

      <p>In this talk Paul walks us through a selection of his
      favourite laws of software engineering and explores how
      developers measure them and if technical writers must also obey
      them. Or not. And what that means for the success of
      documentation in a Free Software project.</p>
