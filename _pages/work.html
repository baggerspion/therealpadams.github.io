  <h1>My Work</h1>

  <div class="feed-header">
    Engineering Leader ■ Certified Scrum Master ■ Team Builder ■ Open
    Source Advocate ■ Chartered Engineer
  </div>

  <p>I am passionate about software engineering and software
    engineers. Supporting and leading high-performance teams of agile
    software engineers that enable those teams and their managers to
    develop, redesign and refactor software applications on time and
    budget is what I do best. Enabling the team and each member to
    apply and enhance their skill sets whilst removing their obstacles
    is how I achieve this. I empower and challenge engineers in order
    to increase their work satisfaction. I focus on agile development
    and on servant leadership.</p>

  <p>I am a Chartered IT Professional and a Chartered Engineer, as
    well as a published author with a passion for leading teams that
    create and continually improve. I have a strong affinity with
    agile processes and utilise them as a means for empowering teams;
    from the most junior member up to their project
    managers. Throughout my career I have worked in a variety of
    environments: system integration, product startup, software
    development consultancy. Most of these businesses have had a Free
    Software focus and, as such, I have gladly been a "hands-on"
    engineer who leads from the front; as is often expected from Free
    Software contributors.</p>

  <p>As a leader, I love working with, teaching and learning from
    others. I have learned that servant leadership is the finest way
    to ensure that you get the most out of your teams: I listen, I
    teach and I help. I work in fast-paced environments and build-up a
    mutual respect with those I work with by enabling them to work at
    their best.</p>

  <p>Empowered and motivated engineers work harder and produce
    excellent results. I am always learning new tooling, processes and
    techniques to enable this.</p>
