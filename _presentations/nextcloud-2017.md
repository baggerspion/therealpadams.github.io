This workshop was a follow-up to my proposed talk on the subject of the official Nextcloud Docker image. In this workshop 
we covered:

- Overview of the current official image vs my proposed new image
- How to build/run the new image
- What improvements can we make to better support the Nextcloud 12 feature set

The intended output of this session was an improved Dockerfile for Nextcloud which can be considered for production use.

No prior knowledge of Docker was assumed, but workshop participants should have Docker installed on their machines to gain 
the most out of this session.
