If you have been following the IoT-trends since before the Internet-of-Things was cool, then you probably are aware that 
the results of having Internet-of-Everything is that all of your connected devices are now pumping out data at a terrifying 
scale. This talk will look at ways to leverage Grafana and CrateDB to store and analyze this data in real time.

This intensive presentation will include a live demo tour of building a CrateDB cluster, populating it with machine data 
using Gantner Q.Station, and then using Grafana and the CrateDB datasource plugin to read realtime data from temperature, 
accelerometer and tweezer sensors.

CrateDB is an open source SQL RDBMS that was designed for machine data. Processing machine data on CrateDB yields 20x 
better predictive analytic query performance over MySQL, and with 75% less database-hardware cost.
