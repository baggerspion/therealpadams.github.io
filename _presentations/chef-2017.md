This session will take you through the journey of learning how we write, build and run packages for Habitat, before 
exploring the packaging of CrateDB. CrateDB, of course, is not just another database and special consideration must be 
given to packaging CrateDB in a CrateDB-friendly manner. In this session we will explore the the endocode/cratedb package 
that is available for download through Habitat and future improvements to this package.
