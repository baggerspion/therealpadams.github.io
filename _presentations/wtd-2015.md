Community Management in Free Software communities is still an emerging field and has produced a spectrum of practitioners: 
from master-manipulators of social media, to those more focused on metrics and data as a means to driving process. Either 
way, the state of the art is still largely driven by the needs of technical contributors to projects.

Good documentation is a crucial component in a software product and yet often technical writers are overlooked as important 
stakeholders of the process. Within the community, there are undoubtedly common problems between engineers and technical 
writers. Software Engineering is full of laws; can we show that these laws apply to technical writers as a means to help 
bridge the chasm between developers and technical writers??

In this talk Paul walks us through a selection of his favourite laws of software engineering and explores how developers 
measure them and if technical writers must also obey them. Or not. And what that means for the success of documentation in 
a Free Software project.
