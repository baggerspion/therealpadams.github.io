One day you're going to wake up and find your little startup ain't so little anymore. You don't all know each other's 
names. You don't know what everyone is working on. The company is no longer a team, it is a collection of teams and each 
of the teams has its own purpose and goals. It's a community. How do we align these teams to build solutions to problems 
larger than any one team can handle? How do we maintain that solution? In this talk Paul discusses InnerSource, the 
application of Open Source best practice inside the enterprise, as a means to build bigger projects across team boundaries.
