One of my final tasks for [Crate.io](https://crate.io) was to record a
video demoing the CrateDB datasource for
[Grafana](https://grafana.net).

Grafana is a tool for visualising timeseries data, using sharable
widgets and dashboards. Most importantly, through the addition of a
plugin, it can be configured to talk to a CrateDB cluster.

## The Video

The purpose of this video was not to produce something
polished. Instead, it was part of my handover as I was leaving
Crate.io. I created this video so that I could pass on some of my
knowledge of how to demo this tooling...

...as you can see/hear this rough cut (literally my second take)
includes all the pauses, "errrr" and nerves ticks that come alone with
an unprepared demo.

Typically I would want to produce/watch numerous drafts like this
before publishing.

I wonder what the final version looks like.
