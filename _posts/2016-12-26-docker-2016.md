At this time of year I normally start making some basic analysis of
the ins-and-outs of some [KDE](http://www.kde.org) projects. This
year, to reflect upon some of the new technologies and communities I
have become part of, I am going to work with some other projects.

So let's take a look at [Docker](http://www.docker.com).

## In Case You Haven't Heard...

Docker is a technology for containerisation: building, deploying,
executing. Here it is [in their own
words](https://www.docker.com/what-docker):

> Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem
> that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools,
> system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This
> guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of
> its environment.

By now Docker has grown to become a crucial set of technologies within
the containerisation ecosystem. So we might expect a strong community
to go along with that. Here are the blue blobs for 2016:

## Some Basic Observations

- That is a huge number of contributors. Until I saw this visualisation, I'm really not sure what my expectataion was. But the relaity exceeds it, for sure. We're looking at 600+ contributors for 2016. Impressive.
- There is a decent core contributor community contributing throughout
  the year (I wonder how many of these controbutors actual work for
  Docker) and recruitment through the year is sound, too. Not least of
  which, a handful of contributors who have clearly become very
  active.
- Retention is pretty bad. Just look at how white this visualisation
  is. The typical contributor commits during one week (I bet it is a
  single contribution on a single day) and then we never see them ever
  again.

This is clearly a strong showing from Docker.
