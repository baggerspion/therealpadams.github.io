At this time of year I normally start making some basic analysis of
the ins-and-outs of some [KDE](http://www.kde.org) projects. This
year, to reflect upon some of the new technologies and communities I
have become part of, I am going to work with some other projects.

So let's take a look at [Docker](http://www.docker.com).

## In Case You Haven't Heard...

Docker is a technology for containerisation: building, deploying,
executing. Here it is [in their own
words](https://www.docker.com/what-docker):

> Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem
> that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools,
> system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This
> guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of
> its environment.

By now Docker has grown to become a crucial set of technologies within
the containerisation ecosystem. So we might expect a strong community
to go along with that. Here are the blue blobs for 2016:
